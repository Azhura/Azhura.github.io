This competition was organized by the kaggle team, to which I had the privilege of being invited. The contest was for guest beginners only, and the general idea was to learn from each other and share information, in this case no medals or prizes were applied, only medals for discussion votes or core votes.
However the prediction model classified us in table, I finished in 234th place very happy, and I have learned a lot of things, thanks to all the very talented people in this community.
